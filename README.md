Welcome
We are working on creating creating an unified way to get information regarding COVID-19 hospital treatment, such as the number of vacant beds available in different hospitals.
This info can be found on specific sites, but we aim to make a unified API by scraping those sites.

People could contribute in many ways

1) providing sites that provide vacant beds for a certain region here: https://github.com/india-covid-stats/covid-beds/blob/sites/docs/sites.md

2) by helping scrape the sites.(using curl, sed, pup, jq and another tool you like) We are trying to store everything in rec file format. And the most important fields to collect are Hospital Name, Vacant Beds, Region, Total Beds etc...

3) or you could work on front end using this data.

We collaborate in this github organization: https://github.com/india-covid-stats
